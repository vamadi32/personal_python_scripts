-  Using your favaourite text editor, save the following in your default shell mine is ~/.zshrc:
```
    export JSS_USER=<enter prod user here>

    export JSS_PASSWORD=<enter prod pw here>

    export JSS_URL=<enter prod url here>

    export JSS_DEV_USER=<enter dev user here>

    export JSS_DEV_PASSWORD=<enter dev password here>

    export JSS_DEV_URL=<enter url password here>
```

# restart terminal/IDE or do:
    

    source ~/.zshrc 
    This is assuming you stored the environmental variables in ~/.zshrc

# sample command to swap to dev:
    
    python3 autopkg_toggler.py dev
