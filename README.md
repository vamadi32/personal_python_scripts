 # Jamf Pro User Cleanup Script

## Overview
This Python script is designed to interact with a Jamf Pro server to identify users without assigned devices and optionally delete a specified number of these users. It's particularly useful in environments where user accounts need to be regularly audited and cleaned up for efficient resource management.

## Features
- Retrieve a list of all users from Jamf Pro.
- Identify users who do not have any devices assigned to them.
- Delete a specified number of users who do not have devices (up to 10 by default).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install with `pip install requests`)
- Access to a Jamf Pro server with appropriate API permissions.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
3. Install the `requests` library if not already installed.
4. Set up environment variables for your Jamf Pro credentials:
   - `JSS_USER`: Your Jamf Pro username.
   - `JSS_PASSWORD`: Your Jamf Pro password.
   - `JSS_URL`: The URL of your Jamf Pro server.

## Usage
Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python3 delete_all_user_no_device_fast_jamf.py
```
